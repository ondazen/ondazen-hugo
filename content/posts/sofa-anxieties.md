I sit crouched on the sofa; I listen to plant’s drip irrigation system and the chirping of the cicadas, with their characteristic strident and repetitive sound. This momentarily soothes me. I think of my present life and of what, presumably, remains for me to live and I feel a sense of anguish. The thought that each of us has his or her own predetermined destiny gets the better of me. What will mine be? And why did that really matter to me? A sense of loneliness corrodes me, just as hydrochloric acid corrodes everything it finds in its path. Or how nitric acid oxidizes gold that is being processed. I listen to Rachmaninov's Concerto No. 2 for piano and orchestra and I wonder if that man had been me. Or at least if I could play like him. Why can't I write an essay like David Foster Wallace? Or a novel like Francis Scott Fitzgerald? Why did this mediocrity take me by the hand and accompany me on my journey? Why don't I have the mathematical intuition of Srinivasa Ramanujan? I could have formulated the ‘mock theta’ function. Or the artistic sense of Gustav Klimt? After all, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer could have been my own work. Why have some been given so much talent while others stay afloat in an ocean of mediocrity?

I doze off on the sofa. I open my eyes and wonder if anything had changed during that period of time. I put myself to the test. I take a stave and try to write a few bars. But no notes present themselves at the ready. Then I try with a poem, but only inconclusive words emerge. Let’s not even mention mathematical functions. I close my eyes hoping that it is just a dream within a dream. Maybe I still have another chance. I repeat the operation, but the same results arise.

I get up from the sofa, go to the bathroom and wash my face vigorously. I brush my teeth with cinnamon-flavoured toothpaste. This reminds me of my childhood, but I am unable to pinpoint the triggering event. I apply night cream, hoping that it will reduce the signs of aging. But why do this after all? I continue to think about how ordinary I am.

I go into the kitchen and swallow a tablet of melatonin, hoping that it will make me sleep until the first light of day. And even though I'm sure it won't, this ritual perpetuates itself night after night. It would be nice to sleep eight hours in a row. But instead this damned insomnia throws me out of bed, as a wife would do with her cheating husband.

I doze off on the sofa again. The same thoughts arise in the middle of the night. Why am I not able to write a symphony like Gustav Mahler? Or to bewitch an audience with my speeches, as Cicero used to do? But I am sure that I will wake up and this sense of anxieties will have vanished with the first lights of dawn, like a wave sweeping away the debris with its undertow. And a new day will make me fall back into a life that I would not have wanted to live.
