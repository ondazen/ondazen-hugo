I can't get to sleep, as usual. As I write these few lines to you, I listen to "Spiegel im Spiegel" by Arvo PÃ¤rt. He is an Estonian composer who writes sacred music. His melodies are so poignant and melancholic. Maybe I should listen to more cheerful music. But after all, I am a melancholic guy. A dreamer. The last of the romantics. Since I was a teenager, at the time of high school, I have developed this passion for the romantic movement: writers, composers and painters who lived in the nineteenth century. Instead of translating the versions from Latin, I preferred to taste the words of writers such as Schelling and Novalis or listen to Schubert's Lieder and Chopin's Nocturnes. You know, at that time I also played Chopin's Nocturnes. I have a great desire to go back to playing those Nocturnes. I'd like to play them for you. I like that you know me in this way, little by little, with my essays and writings. This embodies the romantic spirit dear to me.  I wish you a good night, my dear. And I hope that when you read these lines, you will have known me a little bit better.
